# Bloqedex Backend API

A comprehensive .NET 8 backend API for the Bloqedex Pok√©dex application, built following Clean Architecture principles and integrating with the Pok√©API.

## Architecture

This project follows Clean Architecture principles with clear separation of concerns:

```
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Core/                    # Domain layer (entities, interfaces)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Application/            # Application layer (services, business logic)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ Infrastructure/         # Infrastructure layer (data access, external services)
‚îú‚îÄ‚îÄ BloqedexApi/           # Presentation layer (controllers, DTOs)
‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ Testing/               # Unit tests
```

### Design Patterns Implemented

1. **Repository Pattern** - Encapsulates data access logic
2. **Unit of Work Pattern** - Manages database transactions
3. **Service Layer Pattern** - Contains business logic
4. **Dependency Injection** - Promotes loose coupling
5. **Mapper Pattern** - Maps between entities and DTOs

## Features

### Core Functionality
- **User Management** - Registration, authentication, profile management
- **Pok√©mon Data** - Integration with Pok√©API with local caching

### Technical Features
- **JWT Authentication** - Secure token-based authentication
- **SQLite Database** - Local data storage with Entity Framework Core

## üõ†Ô∏è Prerequisites

- .NET 8 SDK
- Visual Studio 2022 or VS Code
- SQLite (included with .NET)

## Database

The application uses SQLite with Entity Framework Core. The database is automatically created on first run.

### Database Schema

#### Users Table
- User authentication and profile information
- Roles: User, Admin

#### Pokemon Table
- Cached Pok√©mon data from Pok√©API
- Stats, sprites, and type information

#### CaughtPokemon Table
- User's Pok√©dex entries
- Notes and favorite status

## üîê Authentication

The API uses JWT (JSON Web Tokens) for authentication:

1. **Register** or **Login** to receive a JWT token
2. Include the token in the `Authorization` header: `Bearer <token>`
3. Tokens expire after 24 hours (configurable)

## üîÑ Pok√©API Integration

The backend integrates with [Pok√©API](https://pokeapi.co/) to fetch Pok√©mon data:

### Rate Limiting
- Respects Pok√©API rate limits with automatic delays
- Implements retry logic for rate limit responses
- Caches all fetched data locally to minimize API calls

### Data Caching
- Pok√©mon data is cached in SQLite on first fetch
- Subsequent requests use local data
- Admin sync endpoint for bulk data import

### Covered Data
- Basic Pok√©mon info (name, height, weight)
- Stats (HP, Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, Speed)
- Types (primary and secondary)
- Sprites (front default and official artwork)

## üìä Logging

The application uses Serilog for comprehensive logging:

## üöÄ Deployment

### Development
```bash
dotnet run --environment Development
```

### Production
1. Update `appsettings.Production.json` with production settings
2. Change JWT secret key
3. Configure CORS for your frontend domain
4. Build for release:
   ```bash
   dotnet publish -c Release
   ```

### Docker (Optional)
```dockerfile
FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/aspnet:8.0 AS base
WORKDIR /app
EXPOSE 80

FROM mcr.microsoft.com/dotnet/sdk:8.0 AS build
WORKDIR /src
COPY . .
RUN dotnet restore
RUN dotnet publish -c Release -o /app/publish

FROM base AS final
WORKDIR /app
COPY --from=build /app/publish .
ENTRYPOINT ["dotnet", "BloqedexApi.dll"]
```

## ü§ù Contributing
## üìù API Documentation

When running in development mode, comprehensive API documentation is available at the root URL (Swagger UI). This includes:

- All endpoint details
- Request/response models
- Authentication requirements
- Example requests

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **Database not created**
   - Ensure the application has write permissions
   - Check the connection string in `appsettings.json`

2. **JWT token issues**
   - Verify the secret key is at least 32 characters
   - Check token expiration settings

3. **Pok√©API rate limiting**
   - The application automatically handles rate limits
   - Consider using the sync endpoint for bulk imports

4. **CORS issues**
   - Update the CORS policy in `Program.cs`
   - Add your frontend URL to allowed origins
